# Longest Common Subsequence Calculator

These 3 programs calculate the longest common subsequence of two strings using different approaches

## How to Use
1. Run `make pX` (where x is 1, 2, or 3) to compile a specific program 
2. Run `./programX <file_x> <file_y> <output_file>` where X is 1, 2, or 3, and `<file_x>`, `<file_y>` and `<output_file>` are files containing string x, y, and the file to write the out put to respectively.

Alternatively you can compile and run all three programs by running `make args='<file_x> <file_y>'`.
This will compile all three programs, run it with file\_x, file\_y, and write output to a outputX.txt, where X is the program number (i.e. 1, 2, or 3).
